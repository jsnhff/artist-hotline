# TODO List for Next Session

## Quick Fixes (5 minutes)

### 1. Fix `greeting_complete` AttributeError
**Error:** `'WebSocket' object has no attribute 'greeting_complete'`
**Location:** main.py, line ~1690 (silence detection logic)
**Root Cause:** Attribute check happens before initialization
**Fix:** Change this:
```python
if websocket.audio_chunk_count > 100 and not websocket.greeting_complete:
```
To this:
```python
if websocket.audio_chunk_count > 100 and not getattr(websocket, 'greeting_complete', False):
```

**Why it happens:** When checking `websocket.greeting_complete`, if it doesn't exist yet, it throws an error. Using `getattr()` with a default value of `False` is safer.

## Current Status (As of Oct 15, 2025 06:31 UTC)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- WebSocket connection and streaming
- ElevenLabs greeting plays successfully
- Audio conversion (MP3 ‚Üí ¬µ-law): 111222 bytes ‚Üí 55569 bytes
- Greeting message: "Hey! This is Synthetic Jason... I'm basically Jason..."
- Call completes without crashing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues
- `greeting_complete` attribute error (doesn't break functionality)
- Some old emoji logging still present (üîçüîçüîç, üöÄüöÄüöÄ)

## Next Features (When Ready)

### High Priority: STT (Speech-to-Text) Integration
**Goal:** Actually understand what the user is saying

**Options:**
1. **OpenAI Whisper API** (easiest)
   - Add to requirements: `openai>=1.0.0`
   - Buffer audio chunks
   - Send to Whisper when silence detected
   - Get transcription back

2. **Deepgram** (fastest, streaming)
   - Real-time transcription
   - WebSocket-based
   - Lower latency

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Buffer incoming ¬µ-law audio chunks
2. Convert accumulated audio to WAV when silence detected
3. Send to Whisper/Deepgram
4. Get transcription
5. Send transcription to OpenAI for response generation
6. Stream response back via ElevenLabs

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

## Code That Needs Attention

### Silence Detection (main.py:1689-1729)
Currently works but has attribute error:
```python
# Mark greeting as complete after receiving substantial audio (user is speaking)
if websocket.audio_chunk_count > 100 and not websocket.greeting_complete:
    websocket.greeting_complete = True
    logger.info("üë§ User started speaking, enabling silence detection")
```

**Quick Fix:** Use `getattr(websocket, 'greeting_complete', False)` for safe attribute checking

## Testing Notes from Last Call

**Call ID:** CAf4d9f7547a0d3cd9c697dc1a1ed4c51f
**Stream ID:** MZ8b9619170a6e5b88597c2e8d5710185
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-15 06:31:42

**Observed Behavior:**
1. WebSocket connects ‚úÖ
2. Greeting plays (6 chunks) ‚úÖ
3. User audio received ‚úÖ
4. `greeting_complete` error occurs (but doesn't break flow) ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. Call completes successfully ‚úÖ

**User can hear:** Synthetic Jason greeting
**User cannot:** Get intelligent responses (needs STT)

## Future Enhancements (Later)

### Conversation Intelligence
- Add conversation history/context
- Remember user across calls
- Personality tuning

### Production Readiness
- Error monitoring
- Call analytics
- Performance metrics
- A/B testing different greetings

### Advanced Features
- Multi-language support
- Emotion detection
- Call recording/transcription
- Integration with CRM

---

## Quick Wins Available

1. **Fix greeting_complete error** (2 minutes)
2. **Remove remaining emoji logging** (5 minutes)
3. **Add basic STT with Whisper** (30 minutes)
4. **Test full conversation flow** (10 minutes)

---

## Notes

The audio pipeline is ROCK SOLID. The only thing preventing full conversations is STT integration. Once we add Whisper/Deepgram, this becomes a fully functional AI voice assistant!

**Priority:** Fix `greeting_complete` error first, then add STT.
